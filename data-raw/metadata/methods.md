## Trap Equipment
Three in-line 8-foot diameter rotary screw traps (RST).

## Current Trap Location
Traps are currently located in the Lower Sacramento River at RM 75, approximately 5 miles below the confluence of the Feather and Sacramento Rivers.

## Monitoring Schedule
Traps are monitored October through June. Traps are continuously trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions. They are serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch.

## Daily Environmental Data
Daily environmental data collected are flow in cubic feet per second, recorded from the CDEC Gauging station: Sacramento River at Verona (VON); water temperature (Celsius); river Depth (centimeters); turbidity (nephelometric turbidity units); dissolved Oxygen (percentage); conductivity (microSiemens per centimeter); and velocity (meters per second).

## Fish Measurements
Fork length measurements are taken to the nearest mm for Chinook salmon, steelhead, and non-salmonoid fish. For chinook salmon, fork length measurements are taken for 75 randomly selected individuals per category: marked (with an adipose fin clip) fall-, winter-, or late fall-runs; unmarked spring-, fall-, winter- or late fall-runs. Run designated by Length at Date criteria (Fisher 1992). For steelhead, measurements are taken for 75 randomly selected per marked or unmarked. For non-salmonoid fish, measurements are taken for the first 10 individuals (total length measurements to the nearest mm). 

## Fish Counts
All fish not measured are plus counted by hand.

## Trap Efficiency Trials
Fall-run Chinook salmon captured in the RSTs or juvenile Chinook salmon produced by the Feather River Fish Hatchery are the source of released fish. Frequency of once per week from December to May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals and/or hatchery availability allows. A minimum of three consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analyses. Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release site approximately 1 mile upstream of the trapping site, but other sites may be added to aid in developing a trap efficiency. 

## Trap Efficiency Marks
Fish are marked with Methylene Blue or Bismarck Brown Y (BBY) whole body stain. Fish are alternatively marked with a Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) Tag.
